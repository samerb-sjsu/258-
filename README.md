This repository includes a powerpoint with screenshots of all of the steps in setting up:
1. Image Classification with AutoML (flowers dataset)
2. Sentiment Analysis with AutoML (categorize sentence into different sentiment values)
3. Computer Vision with AutoML (classify videos to recognize activity e.g. cartwheel, pull up, etc.)
4. Custom AutoML (image classification with flowers dataset)
5. Tabular AutoML (Regression/prediction of values among different features)
6. Train and Deploy On-Device Image Classification Model with AutoML Vision in ML Kit 
(Extra Credit: Changed project to recgonize food (hamburger, pizza, taco, sushi, etc..) instead of flowers, some problems with app deployment but model works perfectly)
7. Time Series Forecasting with cloud AI Platform and BQML (documented via screenshots in ppt)
